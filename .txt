year2008t) where 1990 is the reference category, the country-speciﬁc intercepts (ui), and the
disturbance term unique to each country at each point in time (eit). As a reminder, all non-di-
chotomous variables are transformed with the base 10 logarithm (log). The coefﬁcient for GDP
per capita is the unit change in the dependent variable for each unit increase in GDP per capita
and captures the effect for the base year, 1990. The overall effect of GDP per capita for the
other time points (i.e., 1 991, 1992, . . . 2007, 2008) equals the sum of the coefﬁcient for GDP
per capita and the appropriate interaction term if the latter is statistically signiﬁcant [35]. This
approach allows the effect of log GDP per capita to vary across years.
The use of interactions between GDP per capita and time dummy variables is the same
modeling approach employed in Jorgenson’s [7] longitudinal study of production-based
CIWB. However, in this study of consumption-based CIWB, we have annual observations
from 1990 to 2008 (due to data availability as described above) and thus interactions between
annual time dummy variables and GDP per capita, while Jorgenson’s [7] study includes obser-
vations and interaction variables in five year increments, but for a much wider time period (i.e.,
1970 to 2009).

Results and Discussion
Table 2 reports the full findings for the estimated model for each of the six samples of nations.
The close to perfect R-square statistics are largely due to the unreported country-specific and
year-specific intercepts (the two-way fixed effects). The two-way fixed effects help account for
omitted variable bias, which would be of greater concern if the fixed effects were excluded since
the estimated models do not include non-dichotomous predictors other than GDP per capita
that are known to impact both carbon emissions and average life expectancy. Table 3 provides
the elasticity coefficients for the estimated effects of GDP per capita for each year, which are
based on the tests of statistical significance reported in Table 2 for the interactions between
time and GDP per capita. Thorough sensitivity analyses indicate that none of the six samples
include any overly influential cases.
For the sample of all 69 nations, the effect of GDP per capita on CIWB was positive and sta-
tistically significant in the year 1990, where a one percent increase in GDP per capita led to a.
045 percent increase in CIWB. All interactions between GDP per capita and the year dummy
variables are positive and statistically significant for the overall sample, and in the year 2008, a
one percent increase in GDP per capita led to a. 066 percent increase in CIWB. The increasing
effect of development was less pronounced in the earlier years of the study, and became moder-
ately more pronounced from roughly 2002 until the final year in the analysis, 2008.
Turning to the sample restricted to the 25 OECD nations, a one percent increase in GDP
per capita in 1990 led to a. 137 percent increase in CIWB. While the majority of interactions
between GDP per capita and the yearly dummy variables are positive and statistically signifi-
cant, the effect of level of development appeared to peak in the years 1998, 2004, and 2005,
where in each of these years a one per cent increase in GDP per capita led to a. 153 percent in-
crease in consumption-based CIWB. In the year 2008, the elasticity coefficient for the effect of
GDP per capita was. 144, which is modestly larger than the elasticity coefficient for GDP per
capita in the year 1990. Overall, the effect of GDP per capita on CIWB for the OECD nations
initially increased in the 1990s, followed by minor decreases through the year 2000, which were
followed by minor increases through 2004 and 2005, and then minor decreases through 2008.
For the “combined” sample of 44 Non-OECD nations, the effect of GDP per capita on
CIWB in 1990 was not statistically significant. Thus, we interpret the estimated effect of level
of development for this initial year in the analysis as being zero. All interactions between GDP
per capita and year are positive and significant. The elasticity coefficients for the effect of GDP
per capita increased from zero in 1990 to. 001 in 1991 and. 003 in 1992, and then began to in-
crease more notably each year through 2008, where a one percent increase in GDP per capita
led to a. 064 percent increase in CIWB.
Fig 1 graphs the annual elasticity coefficients for the sample of all 69 nations as well as the
samples restricted to the 25 OECD nations and the 44 Non-OECD nations. The analyses of
each of these three samples suggest unsustainable relationships between consumption-based
CIWB and economic development, and the analysis of the overall sample hides notable differ-
ences in the dynamic relationships between CIWB and development for the mostly high in-
come OECD nations relative to the Non-OECD nations. While the elasticity coefficients for
the effect of GDP per capita on CIWB increased much more substantially from 1990 to 2008
for the Non-OECD nations than for the OECD nations, the coefficient of. 064 in 2008 for
Non-OECD nations is notably smaller than the coefficient of. 144 for the sample of OECD na-
tions. In other words, while development appears to have become increasingly unsustainable in
Non-OECD nations, economic development continues to be much more unsustainable for the
OECD nations, at least in the context of consumption-based CIWB. We now review the results
of the analyses of the three samples of regionally-defined Non-OECD nations.
As noted in Table 2, for the sample of 16 Non-OECD Africa nations, in the year 1990 a one
percent increase in GDP per capita led to a. 078 percent decrease in CIWB. All of the interac-
tions between GDP per capita and the year dummy variables are positive and statistically sig-
nificant, which suggests that development became increasingly less sustainable for these
nations. Table 3 shows that while the elasticity coefficient for GDP per capita was still slightly
negative in the year 2004 (coefficient of-.001), in the year 2005 the coefficient became positive,
and suggesting that a one percent increase in GDP per capita led to a. 004 percent increase in
consumption-based CIWB. The positive coefficient continued to increase, and by the year
2008 it reached a value of. 021.
Turning to the sample of 15 Non-OECD Asia nations, for the year 1990 the effect of GDP
per capita on CIWB was non-significant and thus zero. All interactions between GDP per cap-
ita and year are positive and statistically significant, and with a few exceptions increase in value
successively, which suggests an increasingly unsustainable relationship between consumption-
based CIWB and development. By the year 2008, the elasticity coefficient for the effect of GDP
per capita was. 076.
The results of the analysis of the 13 Non-OECD Latin America nations are generally consis-
tent with the findings for the Non-OECD Asia countries. The estimated effect of GDP per cap-
ita in 1990 on CIWB for these nations was not significantly different than zero. All interactions
between GDP per capita and the year dummy variables are positive and statistically significant.
In 2008, a one percent increase in GDP per capita led to a. 044 percent increase in consump-
tion-based CIWB.
Fig 2 graphs the annual elasticity coefficients for each of the three regionally-defined sam-
ples of Non-OECD nations as well as the sample of 25 OECD nations for comparison purposes.
The plotted lines in Fig 2 underscore that the increasingly unsustainable relationship between
consumption-based CIWB and development for the overall sample of Non-OECD nations is
largely a function of the trajectories for the Non-OECD nations in Asia and Latin America,
and to a much lesser extent the Non-OECD nations in Africa. While the latter group of nations
experienced noteworthy changes in the CIWB and development relationship through time, the
positive elasticity coefficient in 2008 for the effect of GDP for the Non-OECD Africa nations
(.021) was less than half as large as the elasticity coefficient for the sample of Non-OECD Latin
America nations (.044) and less than 1/3 the size of the elasticity coefficient for the sample of
Non-OECD Asia nations (.076). As important, the elasticity coefficient for the effect of GDP
per capita in the year 2008 for the sample of mostly high income OECD nations (.144) is al-
most twice as large as the elasticity coefficient for the sample of Non-OECD Asia nations.
To check the sensitivity of our results to the specific approach we used to measure consump-
tion-based CIWB, we repeated our analyses using an alternative measure—the residual from
regressing life expectancy on the per capita carbon emissions measures. We used the residuals
from this regression as an alternative dependent variable to the CIWB ratio measure. Positive
residuals indicate higher well-being relative to levels of emissions, while negative residuals indi-
cate lower well-being relative to levels of emissions. This residual approach, which was initially
used by urban political economy scholars [37–38], is used as the primary dependent variable in
other studies on similar sustainability topics [3], and treated as a sensitivity analysis in past
research on production-based CIWB [7]. These residuals, as expected, are close to perfectly
negatively correlated with the CIWB ratio measures. The results of the sensitivity analyses are
substantively identical to the reported analyses of the consumption-based CIWB ratio measure,
providing added confidence in their validity.
Conclusion
This research advances sustainability scholarship on the environmental impacts of human
well-being, and the extent to which socio-economic conditions influence them [4, 7–8, 13–14,
39]. The findings highlight notable differences in the changing effect of economic development
on the consumption-based carbon intensity of well-being across OECD and Non-OECD na-
tions as well as notable differences among Non-OECD nations in different regions. The elastic-
ity coefficients for the effect of GDP per capita on consumption-based CIWB in mostly high-
income OECD nations, which remain relatively stable in value through time, are much larger
in each year than for the Non-OECD nations. Further, there are important differences across
the samples of Non-OECD nations in Asia, Latin America, and Africa, but all of these regions,
which consist of less-developed and developing nations, experienced patterns of increasingly
unsustainable relationships between CIWB and economic development during the 1990 to
2008 period of study. Thus, even with these differences in mind, this research suggests that eco-
nomic development by itself is not a pathway to sustainability—at least in the context of reduc-
ing consumption-based CIWB.
The use of consumption-based carbon emissions in this study leads to differences between
OECD and non-OECD nations that appear to be much more pronounced than when employ-
ing production-based, territorial measures of carbon emissions [7, 13]. In other words, studies
of CIWB and other related outcomes that use measures of production-based carbon emissions
might yield results that underestimate the differences between relatively higher-income and
lower-income nations. As this study shows, for the sample of mostly high-income OECD na-
tions, the effect of economic development on consumption-based CIWB is relatively time-in-
variant and much larger than the increasing effect of development for lower-income non-
OECD nations throughout the world. Besides advancing sustainability science, the empirical
identification of these Global North / Global South differences and the recognition that con-
sumption-based measures more effectively capture societal contributions to overall anthropo-
genic greenhouse gas emissions [16, 20, 22, 24] could help in resolving the ongoing challenges
concerning the formation and widespread acceptance of equitable climate change mitigation
and adaptation international agreements [23, 40–43].
The findings for this study point to multiple avenues for future research. First, future re-
search would do well to consider how other factors might shape the consumption-based CIWB
of nations, including the presence of environmental INGOs and other sustainability-oriented
civil society configurations, the regulatory mechanisms of nations and other political bodies,
and the structural and spatial characteristics of populations within nations, such as urban and
rural population distributions and levels of domestic income inequality. Second, as consump-
tion-based carbon emissions data for an adequate number of nations become available for
years more current than 2008, researchers should examine if the effect of development on
CIWB was impacted by the recent world economic recession. Third, future research should
employ qualitative comparative analysis (QCA), a technique that uses Boolean algebra and is
capable of handling higher-order complex interactions between variables, to identify combina-
tions of factors and conditions that might lead to lower levels of growth or actual reductions in
CIWB (for applied examples of QCA, see [32, 44]). Analyses along these lines would help an-
swer the call for solutions-oriented sustainability research, something that other scholars
working in this particular area of scholarship have highlighted as well [11]. Lastly, with the in-
creasing availability of comparative data at smaller scales, such as the city level [45], US state
and county levels [46], and the province level in different nations [47], future research should
conduct studies at such lower levels of analysis to assess the potential similarities and differ-
ences in observed relationships between environmental conditions, human well-being, and
socio-economic factors at national and sub-national levels, and how the interrelationships may
change through time.
